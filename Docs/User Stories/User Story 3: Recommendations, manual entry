Secondary use: Recommendations, manual entry.

After a user completes their log in to utilize the app they will be have the option to manually search for new tastes 
on the sidebar. To begin they will be presented with a map of their location and if they are not currently utilizing 
the location services within the app they will be able to enter a location and a map will be returned. For this function 
we want to give users the ability to find new music tastes that they previously haven't experienced before. In order to 
do this we will provide the user with a simple search bar where they can enter different music genres to find what is 
around them.

Various locations are then presented to the user on a map allowing them to gauge what is closest and where the popular 
areas are, with the option to switch towards a list view similar to the first recommendations. We envision there will 
be a situation in which nothing is recommended, due to the ability to enter any music genre. Therefore, we will prompt 
the user to redo their search. The user can then click on a specific location to get more information, as well as, a link 
to the company's website, should it exist. If they choose to go to said location an address will be provided along with 
other information. 

Description: The primary function of this use case is to have a narrative surrounding the main use of our product. 
We want to envision a seamless user experience, and as such, it will be integral for us to pay close attention to the 
recommendations function. This serves to not only ensure the right information is being delivered, but that it is being 
delivered in a way that the user can easily digest and use to make his/her life easier.
