When the user is registering/logging in through spotify, the user is prompted with the Login / Connect to Spotify button. 
If the user doesn’t have the Spotify account, the app will simply serve as a google maps and yelp combined search function.
Further setting need to be brought to the user’s attention. First, the user is asked to share their location with the application. 

The user can choose to enter their location instead of granting the application access to the locational service on 
the user mobile device. After complete the first-time flow, the user is presented with the main screen and led into the 
main flow.
