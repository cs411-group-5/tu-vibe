Yelp and Spotify 
	Our idea is to match user’s music taste to venues around the city. An example use case would be an user who are 
  new to a city and would like to explore a city’s nightlife/cafe/etc. The user would allow us to collect information 
  on their Spotify account and we will use their music taste from their Spotify account to determine their “match” 
  to particular locations around the city. This match is determine based on data we get from Yelp. The two main API 
  that would be utilise in this application would be the Spotify API and Yelp API.

Stock trading based on Tweets about corporations’ events
Yahoo Finance 
	Our idea here is to combine yahoo finance data with tweets centering around corporate events to provide users with an 
  oversight on how certain corporate events will influence stock price movements. For example, some of the largest events 
  in the stock market each year come with earnings seasons and corporate events where new products are introduced 
  to consumers for the first time. We want to give our users the ability to make informed trading decisions based on this 
  data by providing them with one central application to access a schedule of corporate events, as well as relevant tweets 
  and financial data once the event gets closer. The main Apis we will utilize are Yahoo Finance API, combined with 
  the Twitter API and Ticketmaster API.
